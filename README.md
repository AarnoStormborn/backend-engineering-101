# Welcome to Backend Engineering 101

In this repository, I will take on small projects to learn & implement advanced backend engineering concepts.

Tech Stack

* Python
* FastAPI
* SqlAlchemy
* Pydantic
* Redis / RabbitMQ


## Advanced Backend Engineering Concepts:

* Background tasks and Messaging Queues
* Concurrency & Resilience Patterns
* Networking & APIs
* Monitoring & Observability
* Security & Modern Auth
* Advanced DB w Postgres

The idea is start a new project every 2 weeks / month depending upon the complexity!
